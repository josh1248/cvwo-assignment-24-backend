# CVWO 2024 Assignment Backend

This is the progress of my Golang backend as of 25 January 2024.

I will be doing my own changes to enhance this beyond the deadline, as I think it is worth learning. Please consider hopping by here to see my product, which I will improve incrementally:
https://github.com/josh1248/forum-website-backend

This Golang app can handle:
- Users: View of users, Creation of users, login of users (with generation of JWT tokens in cookies for successful logins)
- Posts: View of posts

I was unfortunately unable to complete:
- Users: I managed to generate a JWT in a cookie upon successful authentication. However, I have yet to implement post creation by reading off this JWT cookie. JWT verification check implementation is not yet complete.
- Posts: route to create posts.
- Comments in posts.

## Getting Started

### Installing Go

Download and install Go by following the instructions [here](https://go.dev/doc/install).

### Running the backend
1. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository) this repo.
2. [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#cloning-your-forked-repository) **your** forked repo.
3. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory containing your cloned project.
4. Duplicate `.exampleenv` in the root repository.
5. Rename this file to `.env`, in which the server's secret key will be hidden in. It should not be shared with anyone, and will be hidden by this repository's .gitignore.
6. Run `go run cmd/server/main.go`.
7. To ensure that your API is running, check `localhost:8080/api/posts`. You should see a list of 4 posts.
8. Return to the [frontend setup](https://github.com/josh1248/cvwo-assignment-24-frontend).

### Implementation Details

This backend uses Golang. It uses SQLite3 for its database, which is connected via a 3rd party SQLite driver at `github.com/glebarez/go-sqlite`, augmented with `sqlx` for more developer-friendly SQL queries.

This backend uses `go-gin` as its lightweight framework for HTTP server functionality.

This is the main file structure. It is roughly based on the MVC framework. It is generated with the `file-tree-generator` extension at VSCode.
